Graphs in C++

Introduction:

A graph is one of the most fundamental and versatile data structures used in the field of computer science. It consists of a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges that connect these nodes. Each edge connects two nodes, representing a relationship between them. Depending on the nature of the relationship, a graph can be undirected (where an edge doesn't have a direction) or directed (where an edge has a start and an end vertex, often called a "digraph").

Number of edges:
    
        Undirected Graph: m <= n(n-1)/2
        Directed Graph: m <= n(n-1)
    
    where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges in the graph.
    *Assuming no self-loops and no multiple edges.

    Dense --> too many edges (We typically use adjacency matrix representation for dense graphs)
    Sparse --> too few edges (We typically use adjacency list representation for sparse graphs)

Path: A sequence (walk) of vertices in a graph such that all vertices in the path are connected by edges.
Trail: A walk in which no edges are repeated.

Simple Path: A path in which no vertices (and thus no edges) are repeated.
Walk: Similar to a path, except that vertices and edges can be repeated.

Strongly Connected Graph: A directed graph in which there is a path from each vertex to every other vertex.
Connected Graph: An undirected graph in which there is a path from each vertex to every other vertex.

Weakly Connected Graph: A directed graph in which there is a path from each vertex to every other vertex if we ignore the direction of edges.

Closed Walk: A walk in which the start vertex and end vertex are the same.

Simple Cycle: A cycle in which no vertices (and thus no edges) are repeated, except the start and end vertex.

Acyclic Graph: A graph that has no cycles. For example, a tree is an acyclic connected graph.

Where Are Graphs Used?

Graphs are ubiquitous and find applications in various domains:

    Social Networks: Representing people as nodes and their friendships/connections as edges.
    Web Crawlers: Representing web pages as nodes and hyperlinks as edges.
    Transport Networks: Cities can be nodes, with roads/railways as edges.
    Dependency Trees: For example, in software packages where one package might depend on others.
    Biology: Representing networks of ecological relationships or pathways in cellular systems.

... and many more.
Types of Graphs:

    Undirected Graph: Edges do not have a direction.
    Directed Graph (Digraph): Edges have a direction.
    Weighted Graph: Edges have weights or costs associated with them.
    Unweighted Graph: Edges do not have any weight.
    Cyclic Graph: Contains at least one cycle.
    Acyclic Graph: Does not contain any cycles. A special type is the "Directed Acyclic Graph" (DAG).

Common Graph Algorithms:

    Traversal Algorithms:
        Depth First Search (DFS)
        Breadth First Search (BFS)

    Shortest Path Algorithms:
        Dijkstra's Algorithm (for weighted graphs)
        Bellman-Ford Algorithm
        Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

    Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms:
        Kruskal's Algorithm
        Prim's Algorithm

    Cycle Detection Algorithms:
        Using DFS
        Union-Find method for undirected graphs

    Topological Sort (specifically for DAGs)

    Strongly Connected Components:
        Tarjan's Algorithm
        Kosaraju's Algorithm

... and many more, depending on the problem at hand.
Conclusion:

Understanding graphs and their algorithms is fundamental for any computer scientist or software engineer. They not only represent a wide variety of real-world problems but also provide efficient solutions to them. As you delve deeper into the realm of graphs, you'll discover their richness and the beauty of the problems they represent.
