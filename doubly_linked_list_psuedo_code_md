//Psuedo code for doubly linked list in c++:

//The difference between a singly linked list and a doubly linked list is that a doubly linked list has a pointer to the previous node of the current node.
//The advantage of a doubly linked list is that we can traverse the list in both directions.

//Psuedo code for doubly linked list in c++:

DoublyLinkedList:
    
    Node: 
        - Contains data (could be of any type: integer, string, etc.)
        - Pointer/reference to the next node in the list (or null if it's the last node)
        - Pointer/reference to the previous node in the list (or null if it's the first node)

    Operations:

    1. Initialization:
        - Start with an empty list (i.e., head and tail pointers/references are null)

    2. Append (insert at the end):
        - If list is empty, create a new node, make the head and tail both point to it
        - Else, create a new node, make it the next of the tail, and update the tail to this new node

    3. Prepend (insert at the beginning):
        - If list is empty, use the same steps as Append
        - Else, create a new node, set its next to the current head, set the head's previous to this new node, and update the head to this new node

    4. Delete (by value):
        - If list is empty, return
        - Traverse the list to find the node with the desired value
        - Update the next pointer/reference of the previous node and the previous pointer/reference of the next node accordingly to remove the found node from the list
        - Special cases: deleting the head or tail node might require updates to the head or tail pointer/reference of the list

    5. Display Forward:
        - Start from the head and traverse the list in the forward direction
        - For each node, print its value

    6. Display Backward:
        - Start from the tail and traverse the list in the backward direction
        - For each node, print its value

    7. (Optional) Search:
        - Traverse the list from the head or tail (based on which end is closer to the expected position of the searched value)
        - For each node, if its value matches the searched value, return the node (or true). If end/beginning of list is reached without finding, return null (or false)

Usage:

1. Create an empty doubly linked list
2. Perform operations like append, prepend, delete, etc.
3. Display forward, display backward, or search as needed
